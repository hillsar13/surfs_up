# Surfs Up Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare overall temperature trends for June & December months in Oahu. The summary statistics will provide us additional information needed to determine if our surf & ice cream shop will be sustainable year round. 

## Results

The two tables below reflect the temperature summary statistics for June & December:

June Summary:

Several Takeaways:
 - June has an average temperature of 74.9 degrees while December has an average temperature of 71.0 degrees
 - June has a min/max temperature range from (64-85) degrees while December has a min/max temperature range from (56-83) degrees
 - June has a standard deviation of 3.25 while December has a standard deviation of 3.74

## Summary
The results of the temperature summary statistics show several similarities, perhaps a surprise as we are accounting for two different seasons/times of the year. Both month's show a range of termperatures that overlap each other (with December bottoming out at 56 degrees and June hitting an 85 degree high). Otherwise, you are looking at very similar averages in temperature & standard deviation (as exhibited in the results section). However, as we know, climate takes into account far more variables besides weather. Additional queries can give us insight as to other climate & weather factors, such as precipitation, humidity, or wind. We can continue to build our case for the shop by additional queries & insights.
